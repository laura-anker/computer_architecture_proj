# computer_architecture_proj

Note for running the code from this folder using the .jar file. The source.txt file must be in the same directory

# Part 1, due 2/28:

To create
- Design and implement the basic machine architecture.
- Implement a simple memory
- Execute Load and Store instructions
- Build initial user interface to simulator
To submit
- Your simulator, packaged as a JAR file.
- Simple documentation describing how to use your simulator, what the console layout is and how to operate it.
- Test Cases
  - You should be able to enter data into any of R0 – R3; enter data into memory via switches; enter the various Load and Store instructions instructions into memory; enter address into PC and press Single Step switch to execute the instruction at that address.
  - For this deliverable, when the IPL button is pushed the machine should pre load a program that shows that the machine works and stop at the beginning, ready for the user to hit run or single step. This program will be short but show all addressing modes for the load and store instructions, allowing single step through. The program. Memory contents at the address given in the MAR should be on the user console.
- Your team’s design notes
- Source code – well documented.
- GitHub submit logs
